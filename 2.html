  <h2><u>We, as designers</u></h2>
  <p>
    We, as designers, cultivate the art of exquisite visual language, and use our ability to make the world richer than ever. We respect humanity—which media and technology exist for. We believe in visual language that is built by free will of and for everyone. We encourage individual diversity. We create knowledge for all. We aim to foster a universal design community. We honor rightful authority, but not misused authority; inherit noble traditions, and not old conventions. We are the people who realize that visual communication is the most powerful vehicle to change the way we think. And we just might change the world.
